# Changesets

This directory contains [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) which are used to generate the changelog and handle versioning for this package.

When you make a change that requires a version bump, run `npx changeset` and follow the prompts to create a new changeset file.

The changeset will be automatically used to create a PR that bumps the version and updates the changelog when the changes are merged to the main branch.
